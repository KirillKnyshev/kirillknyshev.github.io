    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>You examined Cyclistic bike share data to show how casual riders and members behave. Your goal was to support a plan to grow annual memberships. You used spreadsheets, SQL and Tableau. You focused on patterns in ride length, bike types, stations and ride timing.</p>

    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>Cyclistic serves riders in Chicago. Casual riders buy single rides or day passes. Members pay for a yearly plan. Members bring in more revenue, so leadership wants more riders to switch to yearly plans. Your task was to review past rider behavior and support the marketing plan.</p>

    <h2>Business task</h2>
    <p>Find clear patterns in how members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes. Show the differences with data. Present insights that help the team target casual riders with a strong message.</p>

    <h2>Data sources</h2>
    <p>You used twelve CSV files with one year of ride data. Each record included ride time, bike type, start station, end station and rider type. You also used public bike station data from the City of Chicago. All data was structured and ready for analysis after cleaning.</p>

    <h2>Data cleaning steps in Excel</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Loaded all twelve monthly CSV files.</li>
      <li>Created started_at_full and ended_at_full as datetime fields.</li>
      <li>Created a ride_length field by subtracting end from start.</li>
      <li>Formatted ride_length as time (HH:MM:SS).</li>
      <li>Saved each cleaned file as a new CSV.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data cleaning steps in SQL</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Uploaded all cleaned files to BigQuery.</li>
      <li>Built one combined table using UNION ALL.</li>
      <li>Removed errors and blank fields.</li>
      <li>Created fields for day of week and ride length in seconds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Analysis results</h2>

    <h3>Ride length</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Casual riders ride longer on average.</li>
      <li>Members ride shorter but more frequent trips.</li>
      <li>Max ride times are similar for both groups.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Day of week behavior</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Members peak on Tuesday and drop on Sunday.</li>
      <li>Casual riders peak on Saturday.</li>
      <li>Both groups have longer rides on weekends.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bike type</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Both groups use electric bikes more often.</li>
      <li>Classic bikes have longer ride times for both groups.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stations</h3>
    <p>You identified start stations with high use for each group. These locations support targeted marketing.</p>

    <h2>Insights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Casual riders ride longer and ride more on weekends.</li>
      <li>Members use bikes more often on weekdays.</li>
      <li>Both groups choose electric bikes often.</li>
      <li>Station patterns show strong commuter behavior for members.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The data shows clear differences between casual riders and members. These patterns help shape ads and messages for casual riders. The marketing team can build a focused strategy with these insights.</p>
